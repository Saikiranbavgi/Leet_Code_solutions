    "We often want to reason about execution time in a way that depends only on the algorithm and its input. This can be achieved by choosing an elementary operation, which the algorithm performs repeatedly, and define the time complexity T(n) as the number of such operations the algorithm performs given an array of length n.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the algorithm above we can choose the comparison a[i] > max as an elementary operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This captures the running time of the algorithm well, since comparisons dominate all other operations in this particular algorithm.\n",
    "Also, the time to perform a comparison is constant: it doesn’t depend on the size of a.\n",

    "There can’t be any other operations that are performed more frequently as the size of the input grows.\n",

    "If x isn’t found in a the algorithm makes n comparisons,\n",

    "We choose the assignment a[j] ← a[j-1] as elementary operation. Updating an element in an array is a constant-time operation, and the assignment dominates the cost of the algorithm.\n",
